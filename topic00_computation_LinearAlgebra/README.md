# Topic 00: Computational Linear Algebra

Before Wednesday:

1. Follow the instructions in [Issue #71](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci145-math166/issues/71)

Complete `notes.pdf` before class next week (Wednesday Sep 7).

1. They're not "due", but you will be behind if they're not complete.

1. It's okay if there's a few problems that you can't figure out by Wednesday and need to ask for help then.
