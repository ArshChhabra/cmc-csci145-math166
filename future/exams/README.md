7 students had higher midterm3 scores than midterm2 scores,
and I have adjusted your midterm2 grade accordingly.
In total, and additional 13 points were added to those 7 exam scores,
or about 1.5 points/person on average.

You should verify in sakai that I have done this correctly.

**Overall (after midterm 3):**

Recall that the final exam will be 30% of your overall grade.
