# Topic 01: Pagerank

Before Wednesday (7 Sep):

1. Complete `notes1.pdf` up to problem 2

   (i.e. read through the `deeper-inside-pagerank.pdf` paper and complete the definitions)

Quiz next Monday (12 Sep):

1. Recall that you must get 100% on the quiz in order to pass the course.

   Retakes will result in a -1% penalty on your final grade.

1. The answer key is available in the `quiz-key.pdf` file

   (My apologies for the potato quality... the department scanner wasn't working.)

   Your definitions don't need to match mine exactly, but my definitions are guaranteed to be correct.

1. You will have the first 10 minutes of class.

   If you'd like more time (for whatever reason):
   
   * I'll be in the classroom ~10 minutes early, you can start when you arrive.

   * You can come to my office before class on Monday and take as much time as you need.

Project due next Sunday (18 Sep)
