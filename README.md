## About the Course

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Understand basic machine learning theory
    1. algorithms for regression/classification/clustering
    1. the bias/variance trade-off
1. Understand feature generation methods, especially for analyzing text and social media
1. Understand the ethical implications of data mining
1. Apply data mining libraries (scikit-learn, gensim, others based on class interest) to **real world applications**

This course will **not** have you implementing complex algorithms.
I will be offering a course next semester on deep learning and statistical learning theory that will cover algorithmic implications in more detail.

**Textbook:**

1. Christopher Bishop's *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*.  [Download a free pdf copy from Microsoft Research.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/)
1. Peterson's *The Matrix Cookbook* is a handy reference for multivariable calculus, and [you can download a free copy here](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf).
1. Other articles as posted in the schedule below.
1. Other popular (and freely available) data mining books include [Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/rdehkharghani/files/2016/02/The-Morgan-Kaufmann-Series-in-Data-Management-Systems-Jiawei-Han-Micheline-Kamber-Jian-Pei-Data-Mining.-Concepts-and-Techniques-3rd-Edition-Morgan-Kaufmann-2011.pdf) by Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber and Jian Pei and [Data Mining](http://www.charuaggarwal.net/Data-Mining.htm) by Charu C. Aggarwal.  We probably won't use these books at all though.

**Grades:**

| Category              | Percent |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Homework              | 40      |
| Quizes                | 10      |
| Project (proposal)    | 10      |
| Project (checkup)     | 10      |
| Project (final)       | 30      |

If your project proposal or checkup grades are lower than your final project grade,
then I will replace those grades with your final project grade.

**Late Work Policy:**

You lose 10% on the assignment for each day late.
If you have extenuating circumstances, contact me in advance of the due date and I may extend the due date for you.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss all labs, homeworks, and online quizzes with other students,
subject to the following constraints:

1. you must be the person typing in all code for your assignments, and
1. you may not look at another student's assignment.

You may use any online resources you like as references.

## Accommodations for Disabilities

I want you to succeed and I'll make every effort to ensure that you can.
If you need any accommodations, please ask.

If you have already established accommodations with Disability Services at CMC, please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. You can start this conversation by forwarding me your accommodation letter. If you have not yet established accommodations through Disability Services, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health), you are encouraged to contact Assistant Dean for Disability Services & Academic Success, Kari Rood, at disabilityservices@cmc.edu to ask questions and/or begin the process. General information and the Request for Accommodations form can be found at the CMC DOS Disability Service’s website. Please note that arrangements must be made with advance notice in order to access the reasonable accommodations. You are able to request accommodations from CMC Disability Services at any point in the semester. Be mindful that this process may take some time to complete and accommodations are not retroactive. It is important to Claremont McKenna College to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you are not a CMC student, please connect with the Disability Services Coordinator on your campus regarding a similar process.
