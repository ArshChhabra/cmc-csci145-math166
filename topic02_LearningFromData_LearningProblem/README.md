**Wednesday 2024-09-18:**

I have purchased print versions of the textbook for everyone in class.

If you prefer an electronic copy, you can download one at <https://annas-archive.org/md5/0a99f8c39b197c6ecad82761bcdb4176>.

For next week:
1. I strongly recommend reading the first chapter.
1. I realize that midterm studying will take priority.
