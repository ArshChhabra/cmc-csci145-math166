Midterm Exam
1. Recall: most of your grade is based on exams
1. Signup at <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XeV2M45Iqzum_zDt1I2UzqPB364WgSKhy-krocrDFy4/edit>
1. Format:
    1. Timeslots are for 30 minutes, the exam should take 20 minutes.
    1. I will start by asking you to explain one of:
        1. The power method
        1. The exponentially accelerated power method

       You should prepare in advance a <2-5 minute explanation of each of these methods.
       Your explanation should cover:
        1. The main formulas of the methods
        1. The runtimes of computing those formulas

    1. Then I will ask follow up questions.
        1. Some followups will be directly from the notes packet.

            That is, I will hand you a copy of the notes packet and ask you to solve that problem on the spot.

            1-3 questions of this type.
        1. Some followups will be "smaller" clarifications about what you meant.

    1. Grading
        1. I have a syllabus, but you should think of it as a "vibes check".
        1. You will be graded primarily on the correctness of your answers.
            1. If you say something wrong, I will try to find ways for you to correct yourself.

                It is good to admit a mistake and fix it!!!
            1. Saying something wrong confidently is worse than saying nothing.

                Saying something wrong as a guess, and making it clear that you are guessing, but explaining justifying your guess with good reasoning is good!!!
                It is possible to get full credit this way.

        1. You will also be graded indirectly on your presentation.

            Bad presentation makes it hard for me to identify your knowledge and give you points for correctness.
            
            1. PRACTICE WRITING ON THE WHITEBOARD IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE!!!
            1. DO NOT MUMBLE. TALK SO I CAN HEAR YOU!!!
            1. Do not waste time talking about "trivial" things.

                Talk about things from class that will demonstrate knowledge and let me award points.
            1. Short, succinct answers are much better than longer, rambling answers.
                
                Rambling answers are more likely to include an incorrect statement and result in points off.
                

    1. You MAY NOT use any references or computers.
        There will be no calculations where this should be required.
        If you think it is required, then tell me what you would put into the computer and I will tell you the answer.

    1. This is intended to be practice for technical interviews.

        All of the work you do preparing for this exam will help you get a better job.

    1. I will give you your grade immediately following the exam.
