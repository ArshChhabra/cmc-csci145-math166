# Rubric for data mining project

| Category              | Points  | 
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Figures               | 50      |
| Title                 | 5       |
| tl;dr                 | 10      |
| Body of the article   | 20      | 
| Technical appendix    | 15      |

**Figures:**

A standard final project will have 5 figures, with each figure worth 10 points each.
Additional figures beyond the 5 are eligible for up to 10 points of extra credit each.
Some projects may have fewer than 5 figures if the figures are particularly informative or difficult to generate.
If you believe your project should have fewer than 5 figures, 
then you must get this approved by me by the project checkup.

Each figure will be graded on two criteria:
Half the points are for the technical quality of the figure.
Technical issues you should address include:

1. Are the axes/lines appropriately labeled?
1. Are the ranges of the axes appropriate?
1. Is the choice of bar/line/etc plots appropriate?
1. Is the text in the figure appropriately labelled?
1. Is the figure of an appropriate resolution?

The other half of the points are for the new insights your figure generates.
Every figure must teach me something I did not previously know.

You must have at least 1 figure that:

* shows "what the data looks like"

* provides insight about the data using simple statistics

* shows the results of your estimation procedure

**Writing:**

As with your figure grade, half of your writing grade is based on the technical quality of your writing, and half is based on the new insights that your writing conveys.

Your writeup should satisfy the following requirements:

1. The title should highlight the key insight of your post in 1 phrase
1. The tl;dr should succinctly explain the key insights of your post in 1-4 sentences
1. The body should:
    1. clearly introduce and explain each figure
    1. include appropriate references and footnotes (approximately 2 footnotes and 4 hyperlinks would be typical, although what is appropriate will vary per project)
    1. have a clear "story"
    1. should be divided into appropriate sections
    1. **be readable by a motivated English major**
1. The technical appendix should include sufficient details of your estimation procedure for me to reproduce it exactly; it should also include sufficient explanations of techniques that a math/cs major who hasn't taken data mining would understand what you did

Your write-up must clearly identify at least one of the sources of error discussed in class (estimation error, optimization error, etc.), how that error relates to your problem in an interesting way, and what you did to address that error.
You should include as much of this explanation as possible in the main body of your write-up, 
but parts of this explanation may need to appear in a footnote or in the appendix.
