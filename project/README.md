# Project

**Overview:** 
You will apply data mining to a dataset of your choice.
You will write up your results and share them with the world on social media.
This project will teach you about data mining and technical writing,
and you can add it to your "portfolio" to show future potential employers.

## Submissions

The project is divided into three stages: proposal, checkup, and final submission.

### Proposal

The proposal is due **Tuesday, 1 Oct** at the beginning of class.

The proposal should be no longer than 1 page and contain the following sections:

1. Working title

1. List of project members:  You may work in teams of 1-2 people.  (Larger teams are possible with prior approval from me for sufficiently challenging projects.)

1. Research question/hypothesis: A one sentence statement about what you will be investigating.

1. Background: A 1 paragraph description of why your research question/hypothesis is important.

1. Dataset: A 1-2 paragraph description of the dataset you will use.  Be sure to include information about how you will collect the data, and why the dataset will be appropriate for answering your research question.

1. Publication venues: A list of at least 5 social media communities that you believe will be interested in the results of your project, along with a 1 sentence description about why.  Examples include subreddits, websites like hacker news, and communities on twitter.

### Checkup

The purpose of the checkup is twofold:

1. to ensure that you are making adequate progress on your project, and

1. to create a "grading contract" that I will use to grade your final project.

More details will be posted later.

### Final Submission

Your final submission should contain 2-5 figures and be 4-10 printed pages 
(but we will publish it online).

More details will be posted later.

## Examples

I have a few "theoretical" examples on my personal blog:

1. [How to cheat at settlers of Cataan by loading the dice](https://izbicki.me/blog/how-to-cheat-at-settlers-of-catan-by-loading-the-dice-and-prove-it-with-p-values.html)

1. [How to create an unfair coin and prove it with math](https://izbicki.me/blog/how-to-create-an-unfair-coin-and-prove-it-with-math.html)

Some other examples:

1. DigitalNK: [Gender and North Korean posters](https://digitalnk.com/blog/2017/09/30/gender-distribution-in-north-korean-posters/)

1. DigitalNK: [North and South Korea Through Word Embeddings](https://digitalnk.com/blog/2017/12/23/north-and-south-korea-through-word-embeddings/)

1. DigitalNK: [Visualizing the Korean War: Data Bombs and Propaganda](https://digitalnk.com/blog/2017/10/08/visualizing-the-korean-war-bombs-propaganda-and-data-visualization/)

1. OkCupid: [don't be ugly by accident](https://theblog.okcupid.com/dont-be-ugly-by-accident-b378f261dea4)

1. OkCupid: [exactly what to say in a first message](https://theblog.okcupid.com/exactly-what-to-say-in-a-first-message-2bf680806c72)

1. OkCupid: [the big lies people tell in online dating](https://theblog.okcupid.com/the-big-lies-people-tell-in-online-dating-a9e3990d6ae2)

1. [NLP analysis of net neutrality comments](https://medium.com/hackernoon/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6)

**NOTE:**
These are all examples of how to present data analysis online.
Many of these examples are much more in depth than you will need to do.

## Topic ideas

1. The Claremont Colleges have several school newspapers (e.g. The Student Life, The CMC Forum, The Claremont Independent, The Scripps Voice).  Can we use data mining techniques to quantify the editorial bias of each of these newspapers?

1. I have access to billions of tweets sent from around the world.  Can we determine which topics CMC students are tweeting about the most?  How does this compare to Mudd/Scripps/Pitzer/Pomona students?

1. I have access to all reddit posts ever created.  Given a small set of related subreddits, can we determine what the distinguishing features of these subreddits are?

1. Prof Hanzhang Liu (Pitzer, Political Studies) has a dataset of Chinese newspaper articles about Chinese relations.  Can we use these articles to infer which countries China has close relations with?

1. Prof Gabriel Cook (CMC, Psychology) has a dataset of student written stories that are labeled by the emotions described in the stories.  Can we create a system that automatically predicts emotions from stories?
