<h1>Consortium News Analysis</h1>
<h2>These are notes about analyzing the student newspapers from the Claremont Colleges</h2>
<dt-byline></dt-byline>

<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>The dataset consists of all news articles published online by any of the five Claremont College student newspapers.
TSL by far publishes the most articles.
The data was gathered using the <a href='https://github.com/mikeizbicki/NovichenkoBot'>NovichenkoBot</a> web scraper and includes all articles published before 01 October, 2019.
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/num_articles.png >
<p>
The following plot shows the number of articles published per year by each of the papers.
<dt-fn>The Scripps Voice is not included below because they do not include the publication date of articles on their webpage.</dt-fn>
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/articles_per_year.png >
<p>
Most of the papers are maintaining a relatively constant publication rate,
but the CMC Forum appears to be publishing increasingly less.
The Claremont Independent was founded at about the time the CMC Forum began its publication decline,
and so likely explanation for the decline is that many of the writers who would have otherwise contributed to the Forum are contributing to the Independent instead.
</p>

<h3>Writing Style Analysis</h3>
<p>Compared with TSL, the Claremont Independent uses fewer words in their titles but has longer stories.
</p>

<p>
The Independent also uses a more "academic" and less "journalistic" 'writing style---
the articles are written at a grade level 2 grades higher than the other newspapers using the Coleman-Liau Index.<dt-fn>
We measured the articles' writing levels using Python's textstat library.
The library includes many other measures of readability.
These measures of readability essentially all agree with the Coleman-Liau Index listed in the main body of the paper,
but they are slightly more difficult to interpret.
For completeness, they are reported below.

</dt-fn>

<img class=l-body src=img/articles_stats_coleman_liau_index.png >
<p>
This advanced reading level is not due to longer or more complex sentence structures.
As seen below, the Independent and TSL have similar sentence lengths (TSL is actually slightly longer).
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/articles_stats_body_words_per_body_sentence_count.png >
<p>
Instead, it is due to the use of larger, more difficult words.
he words in the independent average 0.25 more syllables.<dt-fn>This average is calculated after removing stop words, which are words like `a` and `the` which occur commonly in English and have little semantic meaning.</dt-fn>
