<h1>Exploring Twitter Data</h1>
<!--<h2>Place a description of your article here</h2>-->
<dt-byline></dt-byline>
<p>
The folder /data/twitter_claremont on lambda-server contains some example code for working with the twitter data.
The code filters out all tweets within 1mi of my office. 
In total, 5306 geolocated tweets were sent from this region last year.
Since approximately 1% of tweets are geolocated, we estimate that about 500,000 tweets were sent from the Claremont area last year.
</p>
<p>
Here's a plot of the filtered data.

This is nice, but it could be a lot better.

This plot clearly shows the boundaries of the region we're looking at,
and highlights two important subregions.
It becomes immediately obvious that most tweets in Claremont are sent from the Village.
Not shown is that most of the tweets not sent from the village or the colleges are also from other shopping centers;
very few tweets are sent from residential areas.

One tweet was sent only 2.3m from my office chair!
Here it is:
