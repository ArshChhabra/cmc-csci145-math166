## Midterm 1: Pagerank

<img width=400px src=img/2024fall-midterm1.png />

Why oral exams?
1. Mimic technical interviews
1. Teach the [hidden curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_curriculum) of how to succeed in a machine learning career

Common bad habits:
1. bad "pronunciation"
    1. $\epsilon$ is "epsilon" not "ee"

        (in our particular case, "error" or "residual" would be appropriate)
    1. $\mathbb x^{(k)}$ is NOT "x to the kth power"
    1. $\bar P$ is "P bar", $P'$ is "P prime", and $\hat P$ is "P hat"
1. not technically correct language
    1. Incorrect: $\alpha$ is a **random** value

        Correct: $\alpha$ is an **arbitrary** value

    1. Incorrect: Matrix multiplication is $O(n^3)$

        Correct: **The runtime** of matrix multiplication is $O(n^3)$

        Incorrect: $P$ is $O(n)$

        Correct: **The number of non zeros** of $P$ is $O(n)$

    1. Incorrect: $\bar {\bar P}$ is **defined** to have top eigenvalue 1

        Correct: $\bar {\bar P}$ is **defined** to be $\alpha \bar P + (1-\alpha) \mathbb e^T \mathbb v$.

        Correct: One **property** of $\bar {\bar P}$ is that it has top eigenvalue 1.

    1. Incorrect: The power method **helps us calculate** the top eigenvector.

        Correct: The power method **calculates** the top eigenvector.

    1. Incorrect: $O(n^3)$ grows **exponentially**
    
        Correct: $O(n^3)$ grows **polynomially**; $O(3^n)$ grows exponentially
1. No points removed for these mistakes
    1. but they are very annoying
    1. you will not pass a technical interview with these mistakes

Grading rubric:
1. 32 points
    
    16 points for initial explanation of PM/EAPM

    1. Not explaining that PM/EAPM calculates the top eigenvector, which is the pagerank

        You should:
        1. always describe an algorithm's WHAT/WHY before HOW
        1. start big picture; then go into details

    1. Not knowing / being able to derive the runtimes    

        The runtime per iteration is not enough; you needed the overall runtime, for example:

        $O\bigg(\frac{\log \epsilon}{\log \alpha} \text{nnz}(P)\bigg)$

    1. Not knowing typical values / ranges for all values in the formula and **why they are typical**

        1. $\epsilon \in [10^{-3}, 10^{-6}]$ and google used $10^{-6}$; why?
            1. we don't care about exact values of eigenvector, just the ranking of values
            1. $\epsilon$ smaller results in too slow convergence
        1. $\text{nnz}(P) = O(n)$; why?
            1. true in the web domain only

                (people commonly said true of all sparse matrices)
            1. because each webpage has only small number of links

        1. RECALL: I can't cover all these small details in class
            1. you have to do the reading to get all these details and an A in the course
            1. class time is like "preparation" for understanding the reading, not an "alternative" to the reading

    1. Not being able to discuss how changing the value of a hyperparameter changes the runtime / accuracy

        1. Most people got $\epsilon$ and $n$, many people missed $\alpha$

    1. Not being able to discuss why the PM/EAPM converges to the top eigenvector

        1. Lots of ways to explain this that resulted in full credit

        1. Needed to somehow mention the eigenvalues / eigenvectors of $\bar{\bar P}$

    1. Not explaining how the runtimes of matrix multiplication (sparse vs dense) affect the algorithm's overall runtime

    8 points for question from Notes 1

    1. Not knowing the definitions of $P$, $\bar P$, $\bar {\bar P}$. 

    1. Not knowing the definitions of stochastic, irreducible, primitive

    1. Incorrect example/counterexample (usually due to an incorrect definition)

    8 points for question from Notes 2

    1. Not being able to explain the random surfer model

    1. Incorrect example/counterexample (usually due to an incorrect definition)

1. Bigger picture mistakes:
    1. Most "low grades" were due to a "mismatch of expectations"
    1. Answer questions at the "right level"
        1. This requires a good "astheics"
           
           Explain interesting things, gloss over boring things

        1. Very common to answer "too low level"

            <img width=400px src=img/midterm1-toomuch.png />

            For the runtime of an equation, don't show me all the detailed arithmatic; just show me the runtime

            <img width=400px src=img/midterm1-justright.png />

            It's not "wrong" to be too low level, it just takes up time on "trivial" concepts that won't get you points

            (or won't get you hired)

        1. If you're "too high level", it's very easy for me to ask follow up questions for more detail
        
    1. Remember: oral exam / interview is "choose your own adventure"

        1. You are responsible for demonstrating the knowledge

            Don't wait for the interviewer to ask

    1. USE THE WHITEBOARD

        If you don't put things on the board, I can't:
        1. understand what you mean and give you credit
        1. ask follow up questions

Recall:
1. Final grade will replace midterm grade if better.

Extra Credit:
1. You may earn +1 points ec for each letter grade below A.
    (A B can get +1, a C +2, D +3, and F +4.)
